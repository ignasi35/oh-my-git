# There are two conventions for remote aliases which require the `oh-my-git`
# to be parameterised.


# FORK_ALIAS should be set to the alias of your fork. This is either
# `origin` or your <github-username>.
export FORK_ALIAS=origin


# UPSTREAM_ALIAS should be set to the alias of the repository you are
# sending PR's to. This is usually `upstream` or `origin`.
export UPSTREAM_ALIAS=upstream
